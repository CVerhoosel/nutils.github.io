<h2> What exactly is Nutils? </h2>

<p>
The Nutils project is a collaborative programming effort aimed at the creation of a modern, general purpose Python programming library for Finite Element applications. The Nutils library is under active development, and is presently in use for academic research by Ph.D. and M.Sc. students.
</p>

<p>Identifying features are a heavily object oriented
design, strict separation of topology and geometry, and CAS-like function
arithmetic such as found in maple and mathematica. Primary design goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Readability</b>. Finite element scripts built on top of nutils should
focus on work flow and maths, unobscured by finite element infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Flexibility</b>. The nutils are tools; they do not enforce a strict
work flow. Missing components can be added locally without loosing
interoperability.</li>
<li><b>Compatibility</b>. Exposed objects are of native python type or allow
for easy conversion to leverage third party tools.</li>
<li><b>Speed</b>. Nutils are self-optimizing and support parallel
computation. Typical scripting inefficiencies are discouraged by design.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before settling on "Nutils" as a name, the project past by many working
titles amongs which "Beam" and "HOM". Under the name "Finity" the project
gained some traction, and the new situation of having actual users called for
a communication channel for bug and feature tracking. The <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/finity-dev">Finity mailing
list</a> was born. Now replaced by github's issue tracker, below is a small
selection of announcements on that list for historical reference and safe
keeping.</p>

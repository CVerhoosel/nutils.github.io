  <h1> Transform your mathematical formulation into a Python Finite Element simulation. </h1>
  <span>
    <h2> Readability </h2>
    <p>
      A Nutils script focuses on work flow and maths, unobscured by finite element infrastructure.
    </p>
  </span>
  <span>
    <h2> Versatility </h2>
    <p>
      The Nutils library provides tools; they do not enforce a strict work flow. Missing components can be added locally without losing interoperability.
    </p>
  </span>
  <span>
    <h2> Compatibility </h2>
    <p>
      Exposed objects are of native Python type or allow for easy conversion to leverage third party tools such as Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.
    </p>
  </span>
  <span>
    <h2> Performance </h2>
    <p>
      A Nutils code is self-optimizing and supports parallel computation. Typical scripting inefficiencies are discouraged by design.

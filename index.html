        <h2> Readability </h2>
        <p>A Nutils script focuses on work flow and maths, unobscured by finite element infrastructure.</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <h2> Versatility </h2>
        <p>The Nutils library provides tools; they do not enforce a strict work flow. Missing components can be added locally without losing interoperability.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h2> Compatibility </h2>
        <p>Exposed objects are of native Python type or allow for easy conversion to leverage third party tools such as Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <h2> Performance </h2>
        <p>A Nutils code is self-optimizing and supports parallel computation. Typical scripting inefficiencies are discouraged by design.</p>

Welcome at the new home of The Nutils Project, the open source finite element
framework formerly know as "finity". Not much to see here at the moment, but
over time this will be the go to location to read about releases, planned
features, and other news surrounding the project. For now there is the
[about](/about.html) page, and of course the
[github](http://github.com/nutils/nutils/) repository.

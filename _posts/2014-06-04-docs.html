<p>
Preparing for the first official nutils release we are putting some much needed
effort into lowering the entry bar for new users. Today we added <a
href="http://sphinx-doc.org">sphinx</a> documentation under <tt>/docs</tt> and
registered the project at <a href="http://readthedocs.org">readthedocs</a>,
which from this day on will host the official nutils user guide at <a
href="http://docs.nutils.org">docs.nutils.org</a>. In the coming months we will
populate the documentation tree with an installation guide, a quickstart
tutorial, and build out docstrings to provide a meaningful API reference.

<p>
Dear all. In the latest commit
(r1279) I have updated the changelog to summarize our developments since last
release. Please let me know if you feel that anything important is missing.
</p>

<div class="more">

<p>
It is my intention to make one final release of finity, before entering a new
development phase under its new name, nutils. If anyone objects, speak now or
forever hold your peace.
</p>

<p>
Just kidding. You're too late. It's done.
</p>

<p>
This being the last finity version before killing it off, I think it is only
appropriate for this one to bear Ned's name. Perhaps a little celebration
memorial is in place. Next week when the release is out I will bring some cake
to the office. People with too much time on their hands are invited to provide
the <a href="http://notyourmommascookie.com/2012/04/game-of-thrones-cake-pops/">decoration</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Game of Thrones theme failed to shine, mainly because of the extremely low
release frequency. Fortunately, we now have a golden opportunity to fix this.
For reasons that will become clear in a second, let me propose the names of the
next 17 major versions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>"Bakmi" - Southeast Asian Chinese yellow wheat nutils with meat, usually chicken</li>
<li>"Chūka men" - Japanese for "Chinese nutils", used for ramen, champon, and yakisoba</li>
<li>"Kesme" - flat, yellow or reddish brown Central Asian wheat nutils</li>
<li>"Kalguksu" - knife-cut Korean nutils</li>
<li>"Lamian" - hand-pulled Chinese nutils</li>
<li>"Mee pok" - flat, yellow Chinese nutils, popular in Southeast Asia</li>
<li>"Pasta" - made from durum wheat and cut into various shapes, originated in Italy but now known all over the world</li>
<li>"Reshte" - Central Asian, flat nutil, very pale in colour (almost white) used in Persian and Afghani cuisine</li>
<li>"Sōmen" - thin variety of Japanese wheat nutils, often coated with vegetable oil</li>
<li>"Spätzle" - a Swabian type of nutil made of wheat and eggs</li>
<li>"Thukpa" - flat Tibetan nutils</li>
<li>"Udon" - thicker variety of Japanese wheat nutils</li>
<li>"Idiyappam" - an Indian rice nutil.</li>
<li>"Makguksu" - local specialty of Gangwon Province in South Korea</li>
<li>"Memil naengmyeon" - Korean nutils made of buckwheat, slightly more chewy than soba</li>
<li>"Soba" - Japanese buckwheat nutils</li>
<li>"Pizzoccheri" - Italian buckwheat tagliatelle from Valtellina, usually served with a melted cheese sauce</li>
</ol>

<p>
The incentive for releasing early and often is this: As of now, it shall be a
tradition of the nutils project that every major version release is to be
celebrated with the entire development team by dining on the corresponding
dish.
</p>

<p>
Excursions to hard-to-find cuisine are totally allowed.
</p>

<p>
Of lesser importance is that we will aim to adopt a more professional branching
strategy. I still need to study it a bit myself but I think that something of
<a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">this kind</a>, in
combination with extensive unit testing, can prevent the pains that led some of
us, thinking of people in particular, to abandon updates altogether.
</p>

<p>
More information will follow shortly. We will keep finity-dev as our main
communication channel for now, taking this transition one step at a time.
</p>

<p>
First up is Ned's release; probably tomorrow, unless somebody objects. Not you
Joffrey.
</p>

Today the Nutils project is recognized as a [Python
package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nutils). This means you can now install
nutils releases via the [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/) installation
tools as `pip install nutils`, along with all its dependencies. Though thus far
only tested on linux, pip supports all major platforms and we aim to make
installation of nutils a painless experience. Note that for active development
the recommended mode of operation remains to work from an up to date git tree.

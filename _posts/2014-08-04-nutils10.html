<p>Today we released Nutils v1.0 'Bakhmi'. This first stable version embodies a
fairly extensive finite element modelling toolbox that including advanced
features such as isogeometric analysis (IGA), finite cell integration, adaptive
hierarchical refinement, symolic differentiation, and more. An exhaustive
feature overview / user guide is in development.</p>

<p>As per newly instated tradition, the event was celebrated over noodles dinner with
active contributors.</p>

<p>This first ever stable release marks a major milestone in the Nutils
project, which has been under steady development since 2010 and is now
approaching maturity — though we warn that the API is still fluid. At present,
Nutils is in use by several researchers in the field of Engineering Mechanics;
four papers have been published, with Nutils generated results, a fifth
publication is pending, and we are beginning to see adoption in industry.</p>

<p>The release also marks the beginning of a fixed, bi-annual release schedule.
Version 2.0 "Chūka men" is due February 2015, which as it currently stands will
see a major element/topology overhaul, more powerful finite cell operations,
and the beginnings of a Trilinos powered linear algebra backend. Contributions
will be considered for merge into 2.0 until one month before the announced
release date.</p>

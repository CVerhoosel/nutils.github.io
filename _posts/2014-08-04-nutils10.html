<p>Today we released Nutils v1.0 "Bakmi". To try it, download the source from
the github <a href="https://github.com/nutils/nutils/releases/tag/v1.0">release
page</a> or install from <a
href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nutils/1.0">PyPi</a>. This first stable
version brings together a fairly extensive finite element modelling toolset that
includes advanced methods such as isogeometric analysis (IGA), finite cell
integration, adaptive hierarchical refinement, symolic differentiation, and
more. Documentation for this release is sorely incomplete but available <a
href="http://docs.nutils.org/en/v1.0/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Bakmi is a Southeast Asian Chinese yellow wheat nutils with meat, usually
chicken. As per newly instated tradition, the event was celebrated over the
appropriate dinner with active contributors.</p>

<p>This first ever stable release marks a major milestone in the Nutils
project, which has been under steady development since 2010 and is now
approaching maturity — though we warn that the API remains fluid. At present,
Nutils is in use by several researchers in the field of Engineering Mechanics;
four papers have been published with Nutils generated results, a fifth
publication is pending, and we are beginning to see adoption in industry.</p>

<p>The release also marks the beginning of a fixed, bi-annual release schedule.
Version 2.0 "Chūka men" is due February 2015, which as it currently stands will
see a major element/topology overhaul, more powerful finite cell operations,
and the beginnings of a Trilinos powered linear algebra backend. Contributions
will be considered for merge into 2.0 until one month before the announced
release date.</p>

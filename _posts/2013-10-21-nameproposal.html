<p>
Dear Finity users. As you are
all aware, I have been looking for new name for our software stack. One that is
not claimed yet in the .org domain - which excludes all dictionary words except
for "mucky" and some words to do with death. As for the non-words, they are
mostly taken, too.
</p>

<p>
But today, after yet another round of endless variations of numerical,
computational, quantify, finite, etc, etc, I stumbled upon a surprising 'not
found'.
</p>

<p>
May I propose: <em>nutils</em> (pronounced "noodles")
</p>

<p>
A contraction of Numerical and Utilities. A collection in which we identify the
mesh nutil, the function nutil, the plot nutil, etc. Separate entities every
one of them, but they can be intertwined and form bonds in, well, may ways.
</p>

<p>
Ok, I know it's not super. But there really isn't much out there that is
unclaimed and still pronounceable, and we badly need to settle on a name to get
things moving. Let's discuss Wednesday if this is something we can work with.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, feel free to add your counter proposals! Check availability with the
"whois" command line tool or with an online tool like on

<p>
Best,

<p>
Today the Nutils project is recognized as a <a
href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nutils">Python package</a>. This means you
can now install nutils releases via the <a
href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/">pip</a> installation tools as <tt>pip
install nutils</tt>, along with all its dependencies. Though thus far only tested
on linux, pip supports all major platforms and we aim to make installation of
nutils a painless experience. Note that for active development the recommended
mode of operation remains to work from an up to date git tree.

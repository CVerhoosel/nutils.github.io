Preparing for the first official nutils release we are putting some much needed
effort into lowering the entry bar for new users. Today we added
[sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) documentation under `/docs` and registered the
project at [readthedocs](http://readthedocs.org), which from this day on will
host the official nutils user guide at
[docs.nutils.org](http://docs.nutils.org). In the coming months we will
populate the documentation tree with an installation guide, a quickstart
tutorial, and build out docstrings to provide a meaningful API reference.

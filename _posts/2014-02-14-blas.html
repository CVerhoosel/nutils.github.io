<p>
Two months ago I reported on <a
href="https://github.com/nutils/nutils/issues/8">this strange issue</a> that
was triggered by numpy within a forked process, causing the program to hang
indefinitely. A <a href="https://github.com/nutils/nutils/issues/8">duplicate
issue</a> led to <a href="http://www.openblas.net/">OpenBLAS</a> being the
culprit, in particular its multithreading capabilities, which opened up an easy
fix in the form of disabling these via an environment variable
<tt>OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1</tt>. Problem solved. Until last month, when an
update rendered the fix invalid on two separate Debian machines.
</p>

<p>
An alternative fix seems to be to discard OpenBLAS altogether and switch to one
of the many other BLAS implementations. The self-optimizing <a
href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> project appears to work
well, an is easily installed from the package archive as
<tt>libatlas3-base</tt>. Two things to note: 1. Installing an additional BLAS
library makes the machine having to choose from multiple options; an additional
step is required to make it pick ATLAS. 2. The packaged version being
precompiled it is not tuned for the system you are installing on, but also that
is curable. Let's take these one by one.
</p>

<p>
In order to deal with multiple libraries/software providing the same service
Debian uses an <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianAlternatives">alternatives system</a>. A
set of symlinks is maintained in the directory <tt>/etc/alternatives</tt> with
names like <tt>editor</tt>, <tt>mpg123</tt>, and <tt>libblas.so</tt>. Packages
with a <tt>provides</tt> field register alternatives at installation, and the
one with highest priority gets to be symlinked in auto mode. To switch to
manual mode and select ATLAS from a list use the administration tool:
</p>

<pre>
# update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3

There are 3 choices for the alternative libblas.so.3 (providing
/usr/lib/libblas.so.3).

  Selection    Path                                     Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/openblas-base/libopenblas.so.0   40        auto mode
* 1            /usr/lib/atlas-base/atlas/libblas.so.3    35        manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/libblas/libblas.so.3             10        manual mode
  3            /usr/lib/openblas-base/libopenblas.so.0   40        manual mode
</pre>

<p>
Similarly you can change <tt>liblapack.so.3</tt> from the default (<a
href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">Netlib</a>) to ATLAS, even though there
are no known issues with the former.
</p>

<p>
To generate optimized libraries we can follow the instructions in
<tt>/usr/share/doc/libatlas3-base/README.Debian</tt>. The relevant steps are:
</p>

<pre>
# apt-get source atlas
# apt-get build-dep atlas
# apt-get install devscripts
# cd atlas-3.10.1
# fakeroot debian/rules custom
</pre>

<p>
Proceed by installing all the generated .deb packages. They will automatically
have higher priority than the default packages and can peacefully coexist with
the rest of the Debian software stack. Compilation will take a fair amount of
time, and I have not been able to determine if the automatic tuning is affected
by system load (advice appreciated).
</p>

<p>
One interesting thing that came out of the compilation process is that my
processors were not operating in performance mode. Most desktop environments
provide widgets or other means to update frequency scaling, but on headless
servers suboptimal settings may evidently go unnoticed. The build process
suggests to use <tt>cpufreq-set</tt> to change the frequency for each
individual CPU separately, but this will be undone at reboot. Better is to do
as described <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/CpuFrequencyScaling">here</a>, and create a
file <tt>/etc/default/cpufrequtils</tt> to define the <tt>GOVERNOR</tt>
variable:
</p>

<pre>
# valid values: userspace conservative powersave ondemand performance
# get them from cat
# /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors 
GOVERNOR="performance"
</pre>

<p>
Follow this by <tt>service cpufrequtils restart</tt> to update all CPU frequencies, and
keep them updated also after reboot.

Hi all. I am pleased to
finally announce the release of the new finity version, featuring commits from
Rody, Clemens, Timo, Xunxun, and myself. You will find it as finity_200 in the
usual location. For an extensive (yet, no doubt, incomplete) list of changes
please refer to the changelog.

<p>
On the numbering scheme: as of this release we will switch from the former
yymmdd based numbering scheme (which has seen only v130108) to a more
conventional major/minor version number. And, by popular request, we will
identify the major numbers as the houses of a certain popular book/TV series,
and the minor numbers as characters belonging to these houses. We thus refer to
the present 2.0 release as Rickon of house Stark. The version and nickname are
printed as the first line of the html/terminal output such that the logs can be
traced back to the corresponding finity code. Meanwhile the development version
will simply print "Stark" as long as we are building the 2.x series.
</p>

<p>
The current release has been held up by some obscure bugs that took a while to
iron out. Hopefully with new unit tests in place the development process will
be more streamlined from now on, and users of the "Stark" development branch
will experience fewer problems when upgrading their code. This should also make
it easier to release more often from now on, to which I remain fully committed.
</p>

<p>
Bug reports, feature requests, words of praise are all welcomed on this list.
</p>

<p>

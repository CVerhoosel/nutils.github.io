With the nutils project online and under active development, the one thing most
glaringly missing at this point is a project logo. To help fix this situation,
we call on everybody so inclined to reply to <a
href="https://github.com/nutils/nutils/issues/11">this discussion thread</a>
(github account required for posting) with logo ideas.

True to the spirit of open source we choose to make it a collaborative effort
rather than a competition. So if you see something with potential and you have
ideas for improvement, then don't hesitate to build on other people's work. If
you lack the practical skills, but think you have a good idea to share then by
all means do. Be assured that by your shear participation you will gain
acknowledgement for the end result.

Some considerations. The project is called nutils short for Numerical
Utilities. The alternative pronunciation "noodles" lends itself well for a
logo, and I personally welcome artwork inspired around that theme. However, a
really strong logo would combine the gimmick with a reference to the actual
meaning. This is hard, but together we may think of something.

We are looking forward to seeing your ideas!

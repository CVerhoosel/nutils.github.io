About two months ago we started the [colleborative logo effort]
({% post_url 2013-12-28-logo %}) aimed at finding a suitable graphic
mark for the Nutils project. By submitting ideas to a [discussion
thread] (https://github.com/nutils/nutils/issues/11) and building on
each other's work, we hoped to get the benefits of open source in the
creative process of graphics designing. And with success.

Without further ado, we bring to you: the Nutils logo.

<div class="centered">
  <img src="/images/nutilslogo_large.png" alt="nutils logo">
</div>

The details behind the realization of this logo can be read in the
discussion thread. On a most prominent level the logo represents the
letters N and U, first letters of the name and initials to Numerical
Utilities. On a second level, the colors match that of the [Python logo]
(http://www.python.org/community/logos/), referencing the main language
that nutils is developed in. And on a third level, for those that care
to see it, it is a noodle dangling from a blue bowl.

This being a work of collaboration, the result is one that can only be
attributed to all contributers as a group. Our express gratitude to the
creators of this logo:

  * Pieter Barendrecht
  * Rody van Tuijl
  * Timo van Opstal
  * Freek de Bruin
  * Harald van Brummelen
  * Wijnand Hoitinga
  * Clemens Verhoosel

The final artwork is available from the new [logo repository]
(https://github.com/nutils/logo). With [TikZ/PGF]
(http://pgf.sourceforge.net/) and [Poppler]
(http://poppler.freedesktop.org/) installed, running `make` will
generate the logo as pdf, svg, several sizes of png, and a favicon.ico.

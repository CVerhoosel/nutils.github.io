_As appeared on the Finity mailing list_ &mdash; Hi all. As per announced
yesterday I have just committed finity version 2.01. You will find it in the
Finity repository as finity_201.

As usual, for finalized projects it is wise to verify that they work against
the current code (which, of course, you already did) and change the import
statement to point at finity_201 for long storage.

With this release, the finity project will be frozen and will see no further
updates except for emergency fixes, which will be announced here. The other
repositories will remain open for as long as they remain in use. No need to
make any changes at this point.

I will start transferring the ex-finity code to the new repository directly.
Please keep an eye on this list for more information on these developments.

Regards,
Gertjan

Dear all. Now that we learned
about the essentials of git, I would like to invite you all to start migrating
from finity to nutils. You will need to make some small modifications to your
code, mostly trivial ones like changing 'finity' to 'nutils' in your import
statement. But let's make some preparations first.
</p>

<!--more-->

<p>
To obtain a copy of the nutils files:
</p>

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/nutils/nutils.git [target_dir]
</pre>

<p>
If that doesn't work then chances are git is not installed yet. To install on
debian/ubuntu type sudo apt-get install git. On other platforms google is your
friend.
</p>

<p>
As with finity before, we now enter the nutils subdirectory and run 'make' to
compile the numeric extensions, which gives faster tensor contractions and gets
rid of the suboptimality warning.
</p>

<p>
While anywhere inside the nutils repository, to update to the latest version
type
</p>

<pre>
$ git pull
</pre>

<p>
And.. that's all.
</p>

<p>
Though it is not necessary for cloning a project as we just did, I recommend
that everybody make an account at github.org to get access to bug tracking
features. Subscribe to the mailing list by 'following' the project. Later, if
you make some changes to nutils that you would like to be available to others,
this is also a convenient channel to send me pull requests.
</p>

<p>
Now regarding modifications, here is a brief overview of backwards incompatible
changes that you need to be aware of before switching.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Module name: change your import statement from 'from finity import *' to
    'from nutils import *'. Realize that even if you followed all the steps
    before, you are not actually using nutils until you change this statement.</li>
<li>Degree in splinefunc, stdfunc: lowered by one. From now on use degree=1 for
    linears, degree=2 for quadratics, and so on. Be aware that if you do not
    update the degree argument your computations will still run, and you may
    not notice that you are looking at higher order function spaces.</li>
<li>The 'gauss[n]' ischeme now gives the minimum set of points to give exact
    integration up to polynomial degree n. It used to be a set of n points (per
    dimension) which is double that accuracy. If you do not update your code
    then quadrature uses fewer points, potentially resulting in larger errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Internal modifications that should not affect you:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The example scripts like laplace and elasticity moved to a subdirectory 'examples'.</li>
<li>PolyLine.poly coefficient order is reversed.</li>
<li>Element.nodes renamed to vertices</li>
<li>Vertices (formally Node*) are now strings</li>
</ul>

<p>
To make the module available from anywhere in your filesystem, add the following line to your .bashrc or .profile (look for one that exists) directly in your home directory. This applies to macs as well.
</p>

<pre>
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/[dir_to_nutils]:$PYTHONPATH
</pre>

<p>
Note that with that in place it is not necessary to put your own code in the nutils directory. I am aware that this is how some of you have been working; now would be a good time to stop that.
</p>

<p>
The switch will also make a nice opportunity to put your code under version control if you haven't done so so far. To recap on Joost's talk, here is what I suggest.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Make an empty repository.
<pre>
$ mkdir myprojects
$ cd myprojects
$ git init
</pre>
</li>
<li>Copy your old finity code into the new directory and organize it sensibly, get rid of any copies of the same file that differ by a single line of code.
</li>
<li>Port your code to nutils, making all the changes as listed above. Confirm that it runs and generates the same results as before.
</li>
<li>Commit your code.
<pre>
$ git add myscript
$ git commit
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you have a repository of this kind, it will be a small step to later copy it
to mefd02 or github and synchronize between them. That is no more worrries
about which version is where, or what changed when, or why your code doesn't
work anymore when it did yesterday.
</p>

<p>
This officially ends support for finity, meaning bugfixes will no longer be
backported. Of course, the present version will always be around to run legacy
code, though it may be a good idea to pack it along for archiving.
</p>

<p>
Good luck migrating! Let me know if you run into problems that you don't know
how to solve.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Three more items to add to the deprecation list:
</p>

<ul>
<li>mesh.rectilinear no longer interprets a 3-element tuple as arguments to
    numpy.linspace. If you have something of the type rectilinear( [ (a,b,n+1)
    ] ), replace it with rectilinear( [ numpy.linspace(a,b,n+1) ] ).</li>
<li>The 'stack' argument of Topology.elem_eval that has long been deprecated is
    now removed; the replacement argument 'separate' defaults to False.</li>
<li>Topology.project and Topology.projection require an ischeme for ptype=lsqr
    (default) and ptype=convolute. It used to default to gauss8 (finity) ==
    gauss14 (nutils).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Best,
</p>

<p>
Gertjan
</p>

<hr>

<p>
And the last one (promise)
</p>

<ul>
<li>I have just pushed out a commit that renames all coords= arguments to
    geometry=. This is a purely cosmetic change, but one that we will not get a
    second chance at making, and I feel that this name better captures what the
    function represents. All example scripts have been updated as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thanks for putting up with this.
</p>

<p>Today we release Nutils v2.0 "Chuka men". This second stable release brings
advanced support for the Finite Cell Method including trimmed boundary
integrals, as well as many other <a
href="https://github.com/nutils/nutils/blob/v2.0/Changelog">improvements</a>,
and removes the C-extension module which eases deployment on Windows. To try it
out, download the source from the github <a
href="https://github.com/nutils/nutils/releases/tag/v2.0">release page</a> or
install from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nutils/2.0">PyPi</a>.</p>

<p>Nutils v2.0 is the first version that is fully compatible with Python 3 and
also the last version that is backwards compatible with Python 2, support for
which will be removed from the master branch shortly. Development will continue
to focus on speed improvements, as well as laying the foundations for
distributed computing.</p>

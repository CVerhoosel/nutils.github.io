<p>
About two months ago we started the <a href="{% post_url 2013-12-28-logo %}">
colleborative logo effort</a> aimed at finding a suitable graphic mark for
the Nutils project. By submitting ideas to a <a
href="https://github.com/nutils/nutils/issues/11">discussion thread</a> and
building on each other's work, we hoped to get the benefits of open source in
the creative process of graphics designing. And with success.

<p>
Without further ado, we bring to you: the Nutils logo.
</p>

<p>
The details behind the realization of this logo can be read in the discussion
thread. On a most prominent level the logo represents the letters N and U,
first letters of the name and initials to Numerical Utilities. On a second
level, the colors match that of the <a
href="http://www.python.org/community/logos/">Python logo</a>, referencing the
main language that nutils is developed in. And on a third level, for those that
care to see it, it is a noodle dangling from a blue bowl.
</p>

<p>
This being a work of collaboration, the result is one that can only be
attributed to all contributers as a group. Our express gratitude to the
creators of this logo:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Pieter Barendrecht</li>
<li>Rody van Tuijl</li>
<li>Timo van Opstal</li>
<li>Freek de Bruin</li>
<li>Harald van Brummelen</li>
<li>Wijnand Hoitinga</li>
<li>Clemens Verhoosel</li>
</ul>

<p>
The final artwork is available from the new <a
href="https://github.com/nutils/logo">logo repository</a>. With <a
href="http://pgf.sourceforge.net/">TikZ/PGF</a> and <a
href="http://poppler.freedesktop.org/">Poppler</a> installed, running
<tt>make</tt> will generate the logo as pdf, svg, several sizes of png, and a
favicon.ico.

<h2>Separation of immiscible fluids in a cylinder</h2>

<p>Solution of the 3D Cahn-Hilliard equation (without convection) in a
stationary cylinder, simulating the process of phase separation of immiscible
fluids through diffusion under the influence of surface tension. The blue and
yellow manifolds tightly enclose the regions of uniform mixing and can be
thought of as the boundaries of the two phases, which are not otherwise
visualized.</p>

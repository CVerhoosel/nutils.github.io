<p>The nutils project is a collaborative programming effort aimed at the
creation of a general purpose python programming library for setting up finite
element computations. Identifying features are a heavily object oriented
design, strict separation of topology and geometry, and CAS-like function
arithmetic such as found in maple and mathematica. Primary design goals
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Readability</b>. Finite element scripts built on top of nutils should
focus on work flow and maths, unobscured by finite element infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Flexibility</b>. The nutils are tools; they do not enforce a strict
work flow. Missing components can be added locally without loosing
interoperability.</li>
<li><b>Compatibility</b>. Exposed objects are of native python type or allow
for easy conversion to leverage third party tools.</li>
<li><b>Speed</b>. Nutils are self-optimizing and support parallel
computation. Typical scripting inefficiencies are discouraged by design.</li>
</ul>

<p>The nutils are under active development, and are presently in use for
academic research by Phd and MSc students. For more information about the
project contact <a href="mailto:nutils@gjvz.nl">nutils@gjvz.nl</a>, or dive
right in with the example scripts in our <a

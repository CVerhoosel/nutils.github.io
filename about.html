<h1>About Nutils</h1>

<p>Nutils is an open source project aimed at the creation of a modern, general
purpose Python programming library for finite element applications. The project
is led by <a href="http://evalf.com">Evalf Computing</a> and is being
developed in close collaboration with academia, most notably the <a
href="http://tue.nl">Technical University of Eindhoven</a>. Nutils is under
active development and is presently in use for both industrial applications and
academic research.</p>

<img src="/images/laplace.png" width="320" style="float: right;">

<p>Nutils is MIT licenced and is free to use in any application. It is
important to understand however that Nutils is not a ready to use program. It
does not have a user interface and no predetermined functionality. What it is
instead is a collection of high level objects that can be mixed, matched and
extended to build any specific simulation in the form of a Python script.
Knowledge of both computational physics and general programming are required to
use Nutils to its potential.</p>

<p>To illustrate this workflow, the following fully functional script solves
the Laplace problem ∬ ∇v·∇u = ∫ v f on a square domain with various Dirichlet
and Neumann boundary conditions, using quadratic spline basis functions and and
8x8 computational grid. The result is as shown in the figure.</p>

{% highlight python %}
from nutils import mesh, function, plot

# prepare domain, geometry, basis
domain, geom = mesh.rectilinear( [range(9),range(9)] )
basis = domain.basis( 'spline', degree=2 )

# construct matrix, rhs, constraints
matrix = domain.integrate( basis['i,k'] * basis['j,k'], geometry=geom, ischeme='gauss2' )
rhs = domain.boundary['right'].integrate( basis, geometry=geom, ischeme='gauss2' )
cons = domain.boundary['left,bottom'].project( 0, onto=basis, geometry=geom, ischeme='gauss2' )

# solve system
lhs = matrix.solve( rhs, constrain=cons )
sol = basis.dot( lhs )

# plot solution
points, colors = domain.elem_eval( [geom, sol], ischeme='bezier9', separate=True )
with plot.PyPlot( 'solution' ) as plt:
  plt.mesh( points, colors )
  plt.colorbar()
{% endhighlight %}

<p>More elaborate examples including demonstrations of isogeometric analysis,
the finite cell method, and goal based adaptivity can be found in the <a
href="https://github.com/nutils/nutils/tree/master/examples">examples</a>
directory of the code repository. Installation instructions as well as full API
documentation (in progress) can be found at <a
href="http://docs.nutils.org">docs.nutils.org</a>.<p>

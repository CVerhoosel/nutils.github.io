<h1>About Nutils</h1>

<p>The Nutils project is a collaborative programming effort aimed
at the creation of a modern, general purpose Python programming library for
finite element applications. The nutils are under active development, and are
presently in use for both industrial applications and academic research.</p>

<img src="/images/laplace.png" width="320" style="float: right;">

<p>It is important to understand that Nutils is not a ready to use program. It
does not have a user interface and no predetermined functionality. Instead, it
is a collection of high level objects that can be mixed and matched to build
any specific simulation as a Python script. Knowledge of both computational
physics and general programming are required to use Nutils to its
potential.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, the following fully functional script solves the Laplace
problem ∬ ∇v·∇u = ∫ v f on a square domain with various Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary conditions, using quadratic spline basis functions and and 8x8
computational grid.</p>


{% highlight python %}
from nutils import mesh, function, plot

# prepare domain, geometry, basis
domain, geom = mesh.rectilinear( [range(9),range(9)] )
basis = domain.basis( 'spline', degree=2 )

# construct matrix, rhs, constraints
matrix = domain.integrate( function.outer(basis.grad(geom)).sum(2), geometry=geom, ischeme='gauss2' )
rhs = domain.boundary['right'].integrate( basis, geometry=geom, ischeme='gauss2' )
cons = domain.boundary['left,bottom'].project( 0, onto=basis, geometry=geom, ischeme='gauss2' )

# solve system
lhs = matrix.solve( rhs, constrain=cons )
sol = basis.dot(lhs)

# plot solution
points, colors = domain.elem_eval( [geom, sol], ischeme='bezier9', separate=True )
with plot.PyPlot( 'solution' ) as plt:
  plt.mesh( points, colors )
  plt.colorbar()
{% endhighlight %}
